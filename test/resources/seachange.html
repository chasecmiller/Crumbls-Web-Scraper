  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Action Research on Community Adaptation in Bangladesh (ARCAB) is a collaborative platform for learning-by-doing action-research on community-based adaptation (CBA) to climate change. CBA is a "community-led process based on communitiesâ€™, priorities, needs, knowledge, and capacities, which should empower people to plan for and cope with the impacts of climate change" (Reid et al., 2010). CBA is driven by vulnerable communities or starts by identifying communities most vulnerable to climate change. The purpose of ARCAB is to build a knowledge base around CBA action and knowledge transfer to enhance the capacity of NGOs to support climate resilient communities.</p>
